This is the experiment runner for runexp. runexp is a system designed to launch
experiments in several experiment servers using a distributed file system as
communication medium.

Usage:
	$me <MAXJOBS> [<BASEDIR>] [OPTIONS]

	<MAXJOBS>  Mandatory argument that specifies how many experiments should
	           be simultaneously in execution at a time. This argument must
		   be specified before <BASEDIR>, if <BASEDIR> is specified.
	<BASEDIR>  Specify where runexp should look for the jobs and  outputs
		   directory. If ommitted, the current working directory is
		   used. This does not change the current working directory.
	-r <RUNPATH>
		   Specify the directory where jobs should be looked for. Each
		   job either a .m or a .sh file. The default value for this
		   option is <BASEDIR>/runs
	-o <OUTPUTPATH>
		   Specify the directory where the job outputs will be written.
		   When executed, the standard output and the standard error
		   output will be redicted to a file in this directory. The
		   default value for this option is <BASEDIR>/outputs
	-v         Print detailed information.
	
This is a 'works-for-me' kind of system. It works for me, right now, and that's
currently enough. If it doesn't work for you, that could be because you're not
me, or maybe you are me in a distant future and you don't remember why you even
needed this in the first place.

You're currently using an SSH filesystem to establish the distributed file
system that runexp requires. Go to the experiment server, sshfs to your machine
and symlink whatever you need. The experiment server should not know it's not
your workstation.

Once the experiment server is set up, launch the queue manager in your
workstation, then launch the runners in each experiment server. It should go
like this:

	\$ queueexp -r runs -o logs
	\$ ssh user\@experimentserver
	[...]
	\$ runexp 8

This will run 8 simultaneous jobs in the experiment server.
