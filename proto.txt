Communication between manager and runners via sockets
-----------------------------------------------------


This drafts the communication protocol version 1.0


STAGE

1) Initialization
2) Communication


STAGE 1

Server-side

	1. Wait for a connection
	2. When a client connects, wait for the hail "SALUTON"
	3. If a different message is received, terminate the connection
	4. Write "VERSIO <PROTOCOL VERSION>" on the client socket
	5. Wait for client acknowledge with the message "KOMPRENAS"
	6. Start processing this client on STAGE 2, continue expecting other
	   clients on STAGE 1

Client-side

	1. Connect to the server
	2. Send the hail "SALUTON"
	3. Waits for protocol version
	4. If server send the message "VERSIO <PROTOCOL VERSION>" and the version
	   number is acceptable, move to step 5. Otherwise, kill the connection
	   and terminate the execution
	5. Send the message "KOMPRENAS"
	6. Move to STAGE 2


STAGE 2

Server-side

	1. Wait for client to send a message
	2. Message must be in the form "PETAS <NUMBER OF JOBS>"
	3. If the server has no more jobs to run, go to step 7. Otherwise,
	   continue the flow to step 4
	4. Write the name of the next job into the client socket
	5. Decrease <NUMBER OF JOBS>. If <NUMBER OF JOBS> is now zero, go to
	   step 5, otherwise, go back to step 4
	6. Write "PROCEDU" on the client socket. Go back to step 1
	7. Send the message "FINO". Wait for client to reply
	8. When client replies "KOMPRENAS", kill the connection

Client-side

	1. Check how many jobs can be executed at this time
	2. Send a request to the server: "PETAS <NUMBER OF JOBS>"
	3. Start a list of new incoming jobs
	4. Read server socket
	5. Server should have sent a job name; add job to the list
	6. If instead of a job, server sent message "PROCEDU", move to step 7.
	   If the message is "FINO", go to step 10. Otherwise go back to step 3
	7. If list is not empty, launch the jobs informed by the server
	8. Wait for one or more job(s) have finished. Go back to step 1
	9. Wait for server to send the message "FINO"
	10. Reply with "KOMPRENAS". The server will kill the connection
	11. Wait until all jobs have finished executing
